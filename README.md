# Alexide coffee-machine
Lab project of Big Data, Data Minings, and Data Analytics

'Data.csv' file contains data relative to the energy consumption of Alexide's coffee machine

'Date' columns shows the date and hour of the sensor registration

'Energy' columns shows the total energy consumption, (W/minutes), since the sensor was switched on

'Topic' columns shows the topic of the mqtt message recieved by the sensor

Goals:

* Show total consumption as kWh through an heatmap having hours on the x-axis and the day of the week on the y-axis
* Same as above but with day on the x-axis and month on the y-axis
* Avarage consumption for each day as kW
